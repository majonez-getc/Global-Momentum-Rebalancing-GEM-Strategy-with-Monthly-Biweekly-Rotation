# Global Equity Momentum (GEM) ‚Äî Automated Rebalancing Backtests

This repository contains two Python scripts that implement and compare Global Equity Momentum (GEM)-style investment strategies with different rebalancing frequencies:

- **`gem_1month.py`** ‚Üí Monthly rebalancing (classic GEM style)  
- **`gem_2weeks.py`** ‚Üí Biweekly rebalancing (higher-frequency variant)  

The goal is to explore how rebalancing frequency affects performance, drawdowns, and overall strategy robustness when trading major ETFs across global equity and bond markets.

## üöÄ Strategy Overview

The GEM (Global Equity Momentum) strategy allocates capital based on **relative momentum** between global equity ETFs and an **absolute momentum (trend) filter** to decide between risk-on and risk-off regimes.

**Key features include:**

- Momentum ranking using multiple lookback periods (3, 6, 12 months)  
- Optional trend filter using a risk benchmark (default: `SPY`)  
- Automatic rebalancing at chosen frequency (monthly / biweekly)  
- Optional transaction fees and currency conversion costs  
- Optional annual capital gains tax (Polish ‚ÄúBelka‚Äù tax simulation)  
- Detailed result `DataFrame` with all transactions, returns, and cumulative performance  
- Benchmark plotting against selected ETFs
